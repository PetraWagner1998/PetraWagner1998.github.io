                    <p>
                        a 26-year-old web developer from Germany with a passion for creativity and adventure.
                        When I’m not immersed in code, you’ll find me knitting something cozy or hiking the next mountain. I’m happily married, and my home is ruled by a mischievous cat named Linux who keeps life interesting. I love balancing my love for web with hands-on hobbies, and I’m always looking for new challenges, whether it’s in my work or unraveling complex knitting patterns.<br>Life’s an exciting mix, and I wouldn’t have it any other way!

                            <p>Here’s a list of my skills: Over the past few years, I’ve primarily worked as a TYPO3 developer, where I’ve built custom extensions, plugins, and designed the corresponding frontend. One of the highlights was integrating Vue.js apps within the TYPO3 environment, embedding Shopify APIs, and implementing seamless purchasing functionalities.
                                <br><br>
                                This year, I’ve also ventured into the world of Shopware, successfully launching my first Shopware store. This allowed me to expand my technical expertise and gain a deeper understanding of the Shopware platform.
                                <br><br>
                                In several projects, I had the opportunity to fully explore the possibilities within frontend development. I truly enjoy pushing creative boundaries and bringing to life pixel-perfect, user-friendly designs that are both visually appealing and highly functional.</p>
                            <br> In addition I worked in all or several projects with NPM, Composer, Git, DDEV (Docker), SQL, JQuery, REST and much more.

                    <p>
                        An exciting project I have been heavily involved in is the website for Einhell. The site includes over 42 language tenants, spread across seven different instances and data centers. In this project, I had the opportunity to implement the majority of the frontend myself. I was also able to support many areas in the backend, where I developed various extensions, including product management, the blog, and the press portal.

                    <p>
                        The project also involves single sign-on, PIM, DAM, translation services, Solr, Zoovu, and various RESTful APIs for after-sales services especially sylius, dealer integrations, and SAP services.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since 2022, I have been the Lead Developer for all our Einhell projects, working closely with the internal technical and marketing teams to ensure that all requirements are implemented smoothly.

                        Rent and Travel is a booking platform for renting caravans and motorhomes, built on the powerful TYPO3 CMS. The entire booking process, designed to provide users with a seamless and intuitive experience, is implemented entirely in Vue.js. A key feature of the website is its smooth integration with the internal dealer booking system, ensuring an efficient rental process.

                    <p>Last year, my colleagues and I had the exciting opportunity to give the brand a fresh, modern appearance. We succeeded in making the website shine in a new light, significantly improving both its user-friendliness and visual appeal. It was a fantastic project where I was able to contribute my technical expertise in both frontend and backend, while collaborating with a wonderful team.</p>

                    <p>
                        TFK was my first Shopware 6 project and thus a true milestone for me. It gave me the unique opportunity to dive into a completely new technology and expand my knowledge in it. I was able to work through the entire shop process from the very beginning, designing the homepage to optimizing the checkout process. Along the way, I created new custom entities, extended existing ones, and fully immersed myself in the exciting Shopware Experience Worlds.

                    </p>
                    <p>                        One particularly challenging and rewarding aspect of the project was managing multiple sales channels, each with different pricing structures, including net prices and multiple currencies. This complexity required me to thoroughly understand the pricing logic and the specific needs of each sales channel to ensure a seamless and consistent experience across the board.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It was fascinating to explore the various product features and display options, aligning them with the customer’s specific requirements. Through this project, I gained invaluable experience and significantly expanded my technical expertise in Shopware 6. It sparked my enthusiasm for e-commerce and Shopware

                    <p>One of the biggest challenges in this project was organizing and presenting the vast amount of data-millions of products-efficiently and clearly.

                    <p>One of my most challenging projects was undoubtedly the new landing pages for Knaus and Weinsberg. This exciting endeavor presented me with the demanding task of creating a modern and unique user experience that perfectly reflects the brand identities of both companies. It was essential to design an interface that not only captivates visually but is also intuitive to navigate, engaging users from the moment they arrive.

                    <p>
                        One of the biggest challenges was balancing these impressive design concepts with acceptable loading times. I had to ensure that the pages were not only aesthetically pleasing but also technically optimized to deliver quick load times. This is where the extensive use of GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform) came into play, allowing me to implement animations that greatly enhanced the user experience. This powerful animation library enabled me to create smooth and engaging transitions that elevated the overall experience without compromising the site’s performance.
